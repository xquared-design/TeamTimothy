## Intro
This project started as a part of [Makers Making Change Access Makeathon](http://www.makersmakingchange.com/accessmakeathonsummary/), an initiative of the [Neil Squire Society](http://www.neilsquire.ca).
The goal is to help Timothy, a 10 year-old boy with ataxia, play his favourite games on Wii console. This project involves modifying a standard Nintendo Wii Remote and Nunchuk by replacing the buttons and joystick with larger versions and positioning them in a more ergonomic arrangement. The factory PCBs from the controllers are retained and new inputs wired to them. The code is executed using a Raspberry Pi Zero with Raspbian.
